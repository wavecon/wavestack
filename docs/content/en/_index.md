## Open Source

Wavestack is based on a variety of open-source technologies, among them:

- [Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)][scs]
- [OpenStack][os]
- [Kubernetes][k8s]
- [Cluster API][capi]
- [Gardener][gardener]
- [Zitadel][zitadel]

Wavecon is a member and active contributor in different open-source
projects, such as [Sovereign Cloud Stack][scs], [Open
Operations][open-operations] or the [CNCF][cncf-member].

## Digital Sovereignity

Digital sovereignity is important for us and all infrastructure that
is part of Wavestack is run by German companies in our own datacentres
in Germany.

Due to our commitment to utilising open-source software, Wavestack
users can avoid vendor lock-in and are, ultimately, empowered to move
to other SCS conformant clouds or could even host it themselves!
